# My Salty Project
This very salty project is for the [Configuration Management Systems course by Tero Karvinen](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/palvelinten-hallinta-2022p2/)

## The purpose

This project is to create a Salt-state by using SaltStack. The purpose of this Salt-state is to install useful command line tools and programs such as these:

  - Git
  - Micro
  - UFW
  - Trash-cli
  
I decided to choose these programs and tools as I found them useful during my time using Linux with the exception of Trash-Cli but I included it to the list due the recommendation of using the program during this course so I decided to include it in this project.
